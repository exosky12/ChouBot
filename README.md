## 📌 About

ChouBot is a Python script designed to automate the process of creating short, TikTok-ready videos. It downloads clips from Twitch and YouTube, assembles them, and outputs a vertical 1-minute format optimized for TikTok uploads.

## 🧰 Requirements

Make sure the following dependencies are installed:

- Python 3.x
- FFmpeg (must be added to your system PATH)
- ImageMagick
- MoviePy
- Twitch-DL

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clean up folders**  
   Make sure to empty all content in the media folders before running the script (the script is meant to do this automatically, but a manual cleanup is safer for now).

2. **Install dependencies**
  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

3. **Run the script**
  ```python scrap.py```
